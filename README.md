## What is Net Present Value (NPV)?
Net Present Value (NPV) is a financial measure used to determine the profitability of an investment project by comparing the present value of its expected cash inflows to the initial investment or cost of the project. To calculate the NPV, the future cash flows are discounted back to their present value using a discount rate.
